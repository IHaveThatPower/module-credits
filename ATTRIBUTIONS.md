# Attributions
This project wouldn't be possible without the amazing libraries included in it such as [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/), [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify), [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/) and [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/)

## Marked.js & DOMPurify
These two libraries are the backbone for being able to view the Readme, Changelog and Attribution files within foundry. They do all they heavy lifting of converting markdown logic into clean and safe HTMl to be displayed within foundrys windows.

## Popper.js & Tippy.js
These two libraries make it possible to have an interactive pop up element for authors. This is crucial for providing a clean and simple interface for viewing the authors of a module along with any specific links or information they provide.
